Developed an app empowering the visually impaired using Machine intelligence and Feature Engineering, leveraging TensorFlow to 
achieve 85% accuracy in Image Classification (human, animal, background) and Efficient Det Object Detection (posture, gender, action).
Integrated via Android Studio, featuring torch and focus control, along with a voice assistant using Natural Language Processing for text 
and frame narration, revolutionizing real-time scene perception. In a team, represented the project in the YUKTI-Innovation Challenge.

The output of the project is somewhat like this and this would return the statement written in the screenshot in the form of speech to the user.
